#  About Me:
Hi! I’m Ankita, a Master’s student in Computer Science at Northeastern University with two years of work experience in  building ML powered and software systems that actually ship. I enjoy working at the convergence of machine learning, systems, and data, when ideas move from research to real world impact.<br>Previously at Mercedes-Benz R&D, I built production tools, automated workflows, and deployed ML solutions where reliability and efficiency mattered. I’m especially interested in data centric ML, AI agents, and ML infrastructure, figuring out what to train on, how to deploy models efficiently, and why systems behave the way they do.<br>I like clean code, thoughtful system design, and collaborating with people who care about building things the right way. Currently, I’m exploring foundation models, applied AI research, and scalable ML systems.
